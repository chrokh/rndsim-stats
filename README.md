# rndsim-stats

Plot scripts in R for rndsim.

# Usage

The scripts are loading files using relative paths based on execution location. This means that all scripts assume that you run them while being in that folder. Scripts can be run with multiple flags.

```
$ cd rndsim-stats
$ rscript <script.R> <--flag> <value> ...
```

Run `rscript <script.R>` with no parameters to access help menu for all scripts.
